Summary
I responded to the brief by making a game that is random in the dungeons you get, and is somewhat exploratory and action-filled. After researching those who commissioned the brief, I then started brainstorming ideas to come up with the game I made. Based on the premade code/mechanics I had in hand, I brainstormed on possible gameplay I could have made for this project. Also, I had a prior idea for this game before knowing what the assignment entailed, therefore, I also wanted to sort of merge that with this project.

The game features randomly generated dungeons, providing a different experience each time players play. There are also enemies to defeat and crates to destroy in this dungeon as you fight off the invaders of this tomb. The aim of the game is to get to the end of the dungeon while defeating the invaders.

I approached this project by first bringing some prior assignment code into this game. As I had a limited time, I had to scope it small. Therefore, using premade components would decrease the time needed for making these mechanics. I then tried to work out gameplay and rework my code to fit the game I was planning to make. I also needed to work on the other main mechanics, as I wasted time on reworking code. After that, I will work on making the game juicy by adding sounds, animations and UI.

My goals for this project were to make a simple but complete game that could be created within the time limit for this assignment. I also wanted to make it fun and engaging to all players and while also to making it a portfolio piece. I also wanted to work on different systems that I had not worked on for a proper game; therefore, I wanted the chance to make a game using procedural generation and other mechanics that I had not made or worked on before.

How To Play
basically you fight enemies until you reach the end of the dungeon. In the dungeon crates will give the player health when destroyed.
