Summary
I responded to the brief by making a game that is random in the dungeons you get and is somewhat exploratory and action filled. After researching those who commisioned the biref I then started brianstorming ideas to come up with the game I made based on what premade stuff I had. I then just went to work making it.

The game makes randomly generated dungeons giving the player a different experience each time they play. There are also enemies to defeat and crates to destroy in this dungeon as you fight off the invaders of this tomb. The aim of the game is to get to the end of the dungeon while defeating the invaders.

I approached this project by first bringing some prior assignment code into this game as i had a limited time i had to scope small therefore using premade components would decrease the time needed for making these mechnics. I then tried to workout gameplay and rework my code to fit the game I was planning to make. I also needed to work on the other main mechanics as I wasted time on reworking code. After that I will work on making the game juicy by adding sounds, animations and UI.

My goals for this project was to make a simple but complete game that could be created within the time limit if this assignment. I also wanted to make it fun and engaging to all players and while also to making it a portfolio piece. I also wanted to work on differnt systems that I had not worked on for a proper game therefore I wanted the chance to make a game using procedural generation and other mechanics. 

How To Play
basically you fight enemies until you reach the end of the dungeon. In the dungeon crates will give the player health when destroyed.
